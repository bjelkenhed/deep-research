Since the user wants a comparative evaluation focused solely on coffee (not ambiance, wifi, etc.), the research should extract specific data points related to bean sourcing, roasting practices, brewing methods, awards, and direct customer comments about taste and quality.\\n\\nGiven the need for depth and credibility, I will deploy one focused research agent to gather and evaluate:\\n- Expert rankings and reviews from specialty coffee publications\\n- Verified customer feedback highlighting coffee taste, freshness, and brewing\\n- Certifications or affiliations with specialty coffee organizations\\n- Direct data from coffee shop websites about their coffee programs\\n\\nThis single-agent approach is sufficient because the task is a targeted quality assessment, not a broad comparison across distinct categories.
